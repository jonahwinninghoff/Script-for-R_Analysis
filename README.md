##README

##Introduction

This document 'README' is a part of my "Getting & Cleaning Data" course project submission for fourth week. That is, it is a part of Data Science Specialization outlined by Johns Hopkins University.


List of files:
README.md

Run_analysis.R 

CodeBook.md


Run_analysis.R is a purpose of displaying how the datasets merge and how tidy the dataset becomes. The instruction would show every step-by-step detail. In ending, the script should generate a tidy data file that is called "CleanData.txt".

So as to understand what dataset is, the CodeBook.md provides the information.
